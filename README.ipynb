    "## An ML Project using Regression to predict home values\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goals\n",
    "* Identify key features that can be used to create an effective predictive model.\n",
    "* Use regression models to make house price predictions.\n",
    "* Use findings to make recommendations and establish a foundation for future work to improve model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Plan\n",
    "### Acquire the data from Codeup mySQL database\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data dictionary\n",
    "| Feature | Definition | Type |\n",
    "|:--------|:-----------|:-------\n",
    "|**parcelid**| Definition| *int*|\n",
    "| **bathroooms** | The number of bathrooms in the home. |*float*|\n",
    "| **bedrooms** | The number of bedrooms in the home.|*int*|\n",
    "|**square_feet**| Square footage of the house| *int*|\n",

    "### Prepare data\n",
    "#### Dropped rows:\n",
    "* Duplicates   \n",
    "* Rows having 0 bedrooms AND 0 bathrooms \n",
    "* Rows having more than 10,000 square feet\n",
    "* Rows containing null values in any column\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Created features\n",
    "* ```county``` (names based on the fips code):  \n",
    "    - 6037: LA\n",
    "    - 6059: Orange \n",
    "    - 6111: Ventura \n",
    "* ```bath_bed_ratio``` \n",
    "    - Column displaying bathrooms/bedrooms\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other prep\n",
    "* Split data into train, validate, and test sets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explore data in search of drivers of churn\n",
    "* Answer the following initial question\n",
    "    1. Is there a significant relationship between square footage and home value?\n",
    "    2. Is there a significant relationship between the bath-to-bed ratio and home value? \n",
    "    3. Does location have a relationship with home value?\n",
    "    4. Is there a significant relationship between age of the home and home value?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Develop a model to predict the value of a house\n",
    "* Use drivers identified through exploration to build different predictive models\n",
    "* Evaluate models on train and validate data\n",
    "* Select best model based on highest $r^2 score$\n",
    "* Evaluate the best model on the test data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "* ```square_feet``` appears to be a driver of home value\n",
    "* ```bath_bed_ratio``` appears to be a driver of home value\n",
    "* ```county``` appears to be a driver of home value\n",
    "* ```2017_age``` appears to be a driver of home value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "* Run this model against other fips clusters to evaluate it's performance in states and cities other than California\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "* If new trends are discovered between features while evaluating the model's performance in other fips clusters, engineer new ones\n",
    "* Then rerun the newly engineered features with the Orange-Ventura-LA county data for any possible relationship with home value"
